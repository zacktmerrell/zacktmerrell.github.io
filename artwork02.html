      <h4><i>Digital Illustration</i>, 2020</h4>

<p class="description">Chance the Rapper is artist that I have been following since I got into art myself. While Chance the Rapper may not be a digital artist or a painter, he is definitely still labled as an artist creating music. Back in 2012, I took my first "graphic design" course at my high school, which happened to be about the same time that I started listening to Chance's music. Chance and myself have both gone on our own artistic paths, him as a successful and famous rapper and me
   learning the basics of the art I would continue to do for the next decade. It is crazy to listen to the progression in Chance the Rapper's music and be able to connect different pieces that I have made to certain albums or songs. Honestly, with how much Chance's music has been around my art, I am surprised it has taken me this long to create a piece of him, but here it is.
  <br><br>
  This piece is a low poly illustration, so the entire piece is made of only small triangles. This was one of the first portrait pieces that I have done as well. While low poly is my comfort zone, most of my pieces most of my pieces involve nature and landscape images, so this was definitely a learning experience. I would have to say that the eyes and teeth were the hardest parts for me when doing his face, and everything else was just like other pieces I have done. Overall I am super happy
  with the final product and I am looking forward to making this into a collection of works by slowly creating images of other artists.
