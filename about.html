        <br><br><br>
      <div id="bio">My creative work consists of digital illustrations and design, 3D modeling, photography, and even some spatial projects. With influences as local as Jim Phillips and skateboard culture, these forms of new media art are crafted using ideas from traditional abstract values and the modern dialogues of graffiti and skateboarding. The simplicity of geometric shapes, combined with the modern colors of street art, makes the work really jump off the screen or any other medium where the art happens to be displayed.

      <br><br>
I believe that our connection to nature is not only beneficial for us humans, but as well for nature itself. Through my digital illustrations, I strive to bring the organic into my computer, creating a more geometrical form. It is really about breaking down these natural figures into a collection of more straight and clean pieces. In doing this, I feel a bridge is built connecting the purity and evolution of nature with the ever growing and evolving digital world.

      <br><br>
In my personal designs, I strive to create materials for current events to educate and inspire. For my design work contracted by a client, I look to bring their wants to life through a variety of digital programs, working back and forth with them, and ultimately reaching an end product.

      <br><br>
Outside of my artwork, I play soccer for the SJSU Mens Club Soccer team and enjoy music, the ocean, and driving.
