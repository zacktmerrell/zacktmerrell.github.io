      Q1. From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinosaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this affect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.
      <br><br>
      A. I didn’t realize how much of a role art played in the interpretation and “recreation” of dinosaurs. While there was never anything close to a camera around the time the dinosaurs roamed this earth, we are still able to see images of what these creatures looked like when they were alive through art. The only evidence of these creatures that we are able to view as present day humans is their fossils and bones. Art can also have a false representation of these animals; for example the dinosaurs in most movies. These animations don’t accurately show the behaviors of these dinosaurs and leads to people having false ideas on what the earth looked like when dinosaurs walked the earth.
      <br><br>
      Q2. The artist/archaeologist John Conway who is doing interpretations of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other fields of science, creative based disciplines and forms of studies use similar techniques that reminds you of this method or process. Please elaborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.
      <br><br>
      A. I would have to say any study of extinct animals or fossils in a place in which a bunch of interpretation happens. Just like with the dinosaurs, that are extinct, other extinct animals or even fossils of some organisms creates a need for some kind of speculation on what these things did and what they contributed to the world. I would also say something like building engineering would also use some interpretation because they engineer buildings to withstand natural occurrences that would need to be replicated in order to insure the building could withstand that kind of abuse.
      <br><br>
      Q3. First, summarize in your own words the characteristics of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second article. Then given this article's examples for possible future products, how can this same technique also be used to create objects that refer to the past?
      <br><br>
      A. Material Speculation to me is almost like the idea that is put in place first that then scientists and engineers try to achieve. It is like the idea of what is possible. With things like space travel for example - going to the moon, mars rover, etc. - this was all material speculation. With the unknowns of what space brought the first time we were sending things up there, the materials needed where purely speculation at one time.
      <br><br>
      Q4. What are the 4 most common kinds of artifacts listed in the readings. As these are broad categories can you list, some more specific ones?, They may be either a part of these categories as a subtopic or maybe not under these classifications at all. List 4 more categories and give examples.
      <br><br>
      A. History/culture, knowledge, data, and media are the most common forms of artifacts as stated by the reading. There are plenty of other kinds of artifacts, creating a variety of categories and themes, other than those four common ones. Symbols are another very common form of artifact, simply symbolizing the message or goal of the object.
