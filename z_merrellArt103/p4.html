      Q1. What are the differences between site specific art work and the idea of art interventions?
      <br><br>
      A site specific artwork is a piece that was created with the space in mind. The artist would be thinking about the place in which the artwork would exist while planning the piece itself. An art intervention on the other hand is a piece that takes some preexisting thing and changes it to create a different reaction.
      <br><br>
      Q2. What are the similarities and differences regarding the art work of Robert Irwin, Walter De Maria, Banksy, and Robert Mongomery?
      <br>
      Include your thoughts on how their work might interpret ideas of site specificness and/or interventions
      <br><br>
      Robert Irwin is a site specific installation artist who focuses on things like light and pattern and how that takes over a certain space. Walter De Maria on the other hand seemed to create mostly artwork based on interventions and creating that new reaction. Banksy and Robert Montgomery on the other hand seem to be using both ideas in the creation of their pieces. Montgomery’s site specific seems to really push that line between the two ideas, while Banksy’s work seems to be easier to determine whether it is site specific or an intervention. I think Banksy’s piece that was shredded in front of everyone at the gallery is a great example of an intervention piece.
      <br><br>
      Q3. What are the main characteristics that seperate something being any kind of art versus what all signs must share to be relevant or meaningful? This means ALL signs, from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our home.
      <br><br>
      I think it is hard to find the main characteristic with the ideas of Dada art and question what really is or can be. I think the biggest difference would come out of the design. Some signs are just plain text, all the same size and font throughout, while something more artistic would be like the homeless signs project example where these signs, that usually are not created to look good but only get a message out, were created with great care and artistic ability.
      <br><br>
      Q4. What Kind of art, (not shown here), have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description and provide images if possible.
      <br><br>
      I would have to say Brad Downey is a great example of an intervention artist. He is an American artist that lives in Berlin, creating street art by using objects in unthought of ways. I really enjoy the piece that I posted above with the reading because it is something so different to what I have seen before. The idea of showing what is beneath the bricks is very cool and the upright structure of bricks looks very precarious and almost as if you stomped your foot too close to it it would all fall.
