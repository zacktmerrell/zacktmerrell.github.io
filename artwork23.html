      <h4><i>Found/Reused Item Sculpture</i>, 2018</h4>

<p class="description">This is a sculpture that I made out of my electric guitar that has been sitting in my closet for years now. I built the
  electric guitar with my grandpa when I was younger, because I was going through guitar lessons at the time and really loved it. Unfortunately,
  I did not keep up with the lessons and today I don't know any guitar, even though there is a lot of meaning behind my own guitars. Building this guitar
  with my grandpa is one of the greatest memories that I have with him. He passed in the late months of 2016, making that a very hard time in my life.
  When I would look at my guitar, with broken strings, just sit in my closet made me sad. So I decided to beautify the guitar as a way of getting it out of my closet,
  as well as make it so that I am reminded every day of my grandpa and playing guitar with him. I hope to one day find the time and motivation to pick up the guitar again,
  restring it, and start to learn to play again.
