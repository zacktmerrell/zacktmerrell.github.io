      <h4><i>Digital Illustration</i>, 2017</h4>

<p class="description">In this piece, I found this beautiful rose and took a source photo to start my piece. I took the photo into Adobe Illustrator and started to mark off triangles of space that are similar color on the rose. Once the whole rose is covered in triangles, I go back over, selecting each individual triangle, and using the color picker tool, change the fill of each triangle to be the color of the rose inside that triangle. Once every triangle had been colored, I removed the source picture and colored the background black.
  <br><br>
  The finished piece has 1900 triangles that make up the once natural form of the rose. The 1900 triangles is symbolic and is a connection to the song, “La Vie en Rose” by Louis Armstrong, which was released by Armstrong in the year 1900. I choose this song not only because it connects to the source picture I had, but the year 1900 was the start of the century in which I was born, as well as my parents and grandparents. “La Vie en Rose”, being a love song, worked perfectly to show the spread of love throughout my family tree over the century.
