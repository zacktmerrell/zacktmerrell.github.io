Q1. An algorithm is just a set of rules that is followed and then gives you an end goal. If you are an artist or you spend time drawing or painting in your free time, then chances are you most likely have your own personal algorithm as well. Something like drawing a sketch before you start your project or creating a contact sheet for what your project is about. These are starting steps to some example algorithms.

Q2. Something that I do before every one of my projects is sketch is out in my notebook. A step as simple as that can be part of your algorithm. I listen to music every time I am working on my artwork. I feel like I also have different algorithms for different mediums of art.

Q3. Looking at the tree example, I would say that the art is in the software. The software was made to display multiple trees and every time it is run, then a new set of trees is created. So I donâ€™t think that you can say that the trees themselves are the artwork. The code/software is doing exactly what it was created to do so the art piece is  the software and all the extensions, trees, that it makes.

Q5. Well with websites like WikiHow, all the tutorials are made with this satire that makes some of the different sets look a lot like an online comedy routine. But then there are things like cookbooks, especially baking books, because you have to get ingredients so close to perfect to get your end product to turn out both looking beautiful and tasting great.
