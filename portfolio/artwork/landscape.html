      <h4><i>Sticker Design</i>, 2021</h4>

<p class="description">This is a sticker that I designed recently in my Applications of Design class.
  What is interesting is that the original design was made by me back in like 2016 as a sticker design that
  I never got printed. When I found out I have the opportunity to make some stickers through my classses, I
  just had to dig up the file and update this design for my assignment.
  <br><br>
  The original logo is successful on its own, very simple and visually to the point, however I really wanted
  to capture to the spirit and energy that surrounds the mountains during the winter. For me, growing up in
  California, snow trips were a treat and always very exciting so I wanted to capture that a little better
  in the new design. I started by giving the mountains a little bit of depth through darkening the back mountain peaks, as well as,
  adding more clouds and giving them depth like I did with the mountains. Text was a requirement in the assignment for class,
  so that is why I added the type, using a snow themed typeface, and was able to sneak the small snowboarder in there. I wanted to curl the
  type to the bottom of the mountain, just like the curved lines snowboarders carve into the snow on their way down to mountain.
