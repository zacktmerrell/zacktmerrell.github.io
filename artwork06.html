      <h4><i>Digital Illustration</i>, 2017</h4>

<p class="description">This piece, similar to "Heart 'n' Arrow", is part of a bigger collection of low poly illustrations that can be found on my instagram. However, this piece does stand out a apart from the rest for certain personal reasons, so I know that it might envoke something in someone else.
  <br><br>
  The piece is called Poison, not only in the literal sense of it actually being a drop of posion, but because it is actually a name of a song. Poison, the song by Bell Biv DeVoe, talks about relationships and the toxicity some people create; meaning that person is poison. When I made this piece, knowing and listening to that song, it made me think of the
  poisonous relationships I have personally experienced throughout my life, but also made me more concious and grateful for the relationships that I do have that are empowering and uplifting. It represents a bigger picture in my head, something we call reality because some people will be poisonous towards you, it's just about making sure you surround yourself with people that
  offer an antidote, people who will help you through the struggles and battles.
