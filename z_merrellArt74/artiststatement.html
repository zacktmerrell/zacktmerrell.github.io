      <p>My practice illustrates geometric designs with some ethics grabbed from skateboarding and inspiration from naturetttttttttt

      With influences as diverse as Frederick Hammersley to Jim Phillips, this form of new media art is crafted from both traditional geometric abstract values and the modern dialogues of graffitti and skateboard art. The simplicity of geometric art combined with the modern graffitti colors makes the work really jump off the screen or any other medium where the art happens to be displayed.<br><br>

      Ever since I met Jim Phillips I have been in love with the art work, the process, and the time that goes into designing one piece of art that will be printed on thousands of skateboards. Through my journey of creating skateboard inspired art and recreating some of my favorites from Jim Phillips and others, I have always seemed to love creating art with nice clean lines. Creating skateboard art out of only triangles or taking a piece of art and turning its curvy lines into straight lines brings this modern feel with a older Hammersley look to aome of the art. I have a little 3D modeling background as well; I have modeled things as easy as a couple shelfs to the Space Needle in Seattle. <br><br>

      As this New Media Art starts to take over the world, I want to keep some of these traditional looks and give the viewer a timeless look to everything. It's important that older works or older styles can be made to look new again or kept the way they are to really bring out the history behind art and how we got to the New Media Art we have today.<br><br>
