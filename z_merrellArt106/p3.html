         <h5>Chapter #1</h5>
		<p>
		The first chapter of the reading starts off by talking about how we are all cyborgs. Maybe not in the typical idea of cyborgs of being actually part robot (I liked the reference he used with terminator), but in a sense that we as a human species rely heavily on the electronics around us. With almost everyone walking around today with a super compact computer in their pockets it allows for us to have to think less. Data stored in a device that is on our person almost 24/7 that can tell you how to get to the nearest grocery store or what the distance between the earth and the sun is in a matter of seconds. This is what distances us from other animals. Biologically we are not much different than most animals, on the molecular scale that is, but our ability to have access to something that can answer almost all your questions and fill all your needs is what puts us ahead.
    <br><br>
    It then goes into talking about the origin of the word cyborg and man that is credited with using that word first, Manfred Clynes. Clynes states that the idea of a cyborg is someone who, “deliberately incorporates exogenous components extending the self-regulating control function of the organism in order to adapt it to new environments”. The best example for that in the reading that I found was the auditory devices. In new days audio prosthesis the microphone is implanted into the ear and connects directly to the brain stem itself. These are the exact ideas that Clyne was talking about when he used the term cyborg back in the mid 1900s. The chapter then summarizes by talking again about the idea of non-penetrative cyborgs and how it is almost more of a relationship than anything. Everyone, as I have said, has a small computer in their pocket, and while I might not be a physical part of you, it is a part of who you are.
    <br><br>
    1. Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Klines &  Clines definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book?
    <br>
    A. I think the main differences between Clyne and Clarks idea of cyborg are different but I also think there is an explanation to that. I think Clyne's ideas were much like the traditional cyborg we all see in movies while Clark leans more to the relationship between human and machine aspect. I think it has to do with the time period though. Clark’s ideas came much later after technology had been advanced and around for longer.
    <br><br>
    2. From The book, "Cyberneticists were especially interested in self-regulating systems."
What are 2 or more example of these, make sure to include both biological systems and also non-biological systems.
    <br>
    A. Two examples of Self Regulating Systems would have to be like your hot water at home, because it turns on automatically when you need hot water, and sweating. Sweating is a basic human function that our body does without us having to do anything, we just overheat and our bodies starts to produce sweat to cool us.
    <br><br>
    3. What other kind of definitions of a hybrid humans are there that are not based on definations above but popular in literature, media culture, etc.
    <br>
    A. Well I think that the reading only talked about the idea of cyborg human-hybrids and left out the idea of human hybrids with animals.

         <h5>Chapter #2</h5>
		<p>
		The second chapter starts off by talking about this idea of transparent and opaque technologies. This is an idea that some things become transparent in their form of use. Like for example your brain, it isn’t literally invisible but you don’t see it and may not know how it works, but still you use it effortlessly so it is a form of transparent technology. Something like your phone on the other hand would be an example of an opaque technology. You may know how to use your phone like the back of your hand but you still are looking at it, consciously using it, and even having problems with it at times. An opaque technology is something that constantly trips the user up, so whether it is no battery life or no signal, your phone constantly trips you up.
    <br><br>
    The chapter then goes into more detail on a lot of these technologies, but also brings up this new phrase, Information Appliances. They break down this idea into three easy features; 1) An information appliance is geared to support a specific activity, and to do so via the storage, reception, processing, and transmission of information, 2) Information appliances form an intercommunicating web. They can “talk” to each other, and 3) Information appliances are transparent technologies, designed to be easy to use, and to fade into the background. They are poised to be taken for granted. So a very basic kind of information appliance would be something like your oven. It cooks your food for you based on the information you give it.
    <br><br>
    1. Summarize a definition as described in the book of what the significant attributes  are for 'opaque' technology vs.   'transparent' technology.
    <br>
    A. Opaque technology is technology that is not perfectly streamlined, something that trips you up during use. Invisible technology is something that is used effortlessly and also can not be “seen” by the user, like your brain.
    <br><br>
    2. Give some examples of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent and and also give some example of a technology that should be more opaque.
    <br>
    A. Something like our phones that we always have on us would be cool to make it transparent because then we could do everything our phone does effortlessly and with the need to charge the battery or anything like that. Something like electrical circuit would be a good technology that could be opaque. You don’t see the current running through the circuit so you don’t know if its working, unless you added an LED, but it you could see the current it would make it easier.
    <br><br>
    3. Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book, seem valid to you? Why?
    <br>
    A. I am honestly a little stumped by the watch example in the reading. I don’t know if it falls into the transparent category even though we so often say we know the time before looking at our watch to actually mentally figure out the exact time. I feel like the watch is the closest you can get to transparent technology with actually being transparent technology.
