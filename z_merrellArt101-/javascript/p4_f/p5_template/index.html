<h1> Weather </h1>

<p>  This is my Weather code. Even though I would like to do more to this code, I had to stop here due to lack of time. I have created
a simple weather broadcast for a few different places. The first ball that is colored in white is actually the ball representing your current position. The rest
of the balls are all from popular places. The motion of the balls is connected to the current temp and wind speeds for that place. The size of the balls
corresponds to the humidity and the color is connected to the max and min for the time!</p>
