	In my final project I wanted to create a beat maker of some sort. I wanted to take into account the reading and use the ideas of Skeuomorphism to represent the different notes. So instead of using actual music notes for each different one, I just used the letters that represent the individual notes. For my different states, I made a “help” state just in case people need a little help or explanation of what is going on. I also added a pause button so that the sequence could be paused instead of constantly running. The different selectors and sliders at the bottom adjust the instrument, tempo, and volume respectively.
	
	For my project I am worried about a few different coding parts that I know I will have trouble on. I am still having trouble with the libraries to this day but besides that I am worried about the different scenes. Especially the pause and help phases. For the pause phase I am just worried about how to get the pause button to pop up and disappear when the pause button is pressed or not, but that one isn’t terrible. The help phase is the one I am worried about because I want to try and get a rectangle to overlay the screen, not the whole screen, in order to display a few lines that explain the program. The only other thing I would think to need help with is how I can get each letter to be moveable. I want to be able to move the letters all over the screen so someone can rearrange them in any way they want to try and make a beat with these notes.
