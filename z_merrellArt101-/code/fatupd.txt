	In my final project I wanted to create a beat maker of some sort. I wanted to take into account the reading and use the ideas of Skeuomorphism to represent the different notes. So instead of using actual music notes for each different one, I just used the letters that represent the individual notes. For my different states, I made a “help” state just in case people need a little help or explanation of what is going on. I also added a pause button so that the sequence could be paused instead of constantly running. The different selectors and sliders at the bottom adjust the instrument, tempo, and volume respectively.
	
	I got this as my final result and, even though it could be improved, I am glad I got all the basic functions I wanted to work. The click to pick up and drop function works perfect after a lot of time and fixing and all the buttons control the different variables I had talked about. All in all I am happy with what I got.

	With this project and the idea of basing it off the reading I wanted to create a super flat interface of the slider and different buttons down at the bottom but I wanted to have the objects, or bugs, be more skeuomorphic, even though they are cartoon mockups of the bugs. The bugs relate to skeuomorphism because the artwork is based on real world examples, while the interface is flat because it just uses basic squares and rectangles.
